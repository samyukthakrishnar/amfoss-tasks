#Terminal-Hunt- Task-01
part 1

facility discovered 
 
The gravity equation,
    the string is: T25lIGxhc3QgdGFzaywgYW5kIHlvdSdsbCBoYXZlIHN1Y2Nlc3NmdWxseSBjb21

Its meaning holds power... and danger.
Now that the facility has fulfilled its purpose, it's time to cover your tracks, erase it. 
Wipe it from existence so no one — and nothing — can trace your path.
The future depends on secrecy.

Decoded string: "One last task, and you'll have successfully com"

Learnt to use: mkdir,rm,cat,nano,ls,cd,find and grep commands
 
The facility has been wiped as instructed

part 2

Well done, traveller
You've managed to breach the distortions near Saturn's ring and accessed the wormhole node
    This is the second key wbGV0ZWQgdGhlIFRlcm1pbmFsIEh1bnQhIFJ1biBncmF2aXR5

Decoded string: "leted the Terminal Hunt! Run gravity"

But now, your mission isn't just to discover... it's to protect
Back up the solutions.md to the safest place you know
And what could be safer than your Home Sweet Home

learnt to use: chmod +x .file.sh and ./ 

Note: string had some error , got the decoded message when I removed the "w"
