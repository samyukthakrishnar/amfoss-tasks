# Task-13: Hugo Portfolio Website

## What I Did

I created a personalized portfolio website using Hugo, an open-source static site generator. I explored Hugo's theme library to find a template that matched my style, then customized it to showcase my work and projects. 

The process involved:
- Installing Hugo and setting up the project structure
- Selecting and configuring a suitable theme
- Adding my content through Markdown files
- Customizing the design and layout to reflect my personal brand
- Deploying the website to GitHub Pages for public access

## Key Learning

I learned how static site generators work and discovered that professional websites can be built without writing code from scratch. Hugo's approach of separating content (Markdown) from presentation (themes) made it easy to focus on showcasing my work rather than technical implementation.

The project taught me about modern web deployment workflows using Git and GitHub Pages, where pushing changes to the repository automatically updates the live website.
