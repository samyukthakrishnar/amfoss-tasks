# Terminal-Hunt

The Earth is dying- a land choked with dust, stripped of its harvest by the parching nature of man. Nature has turned hostile; it is no longer a home but a warning. Interstellar, then: apocalypse not by fire but by a slow, silent surrender. It is my survival that is assured if I look to the stars; to stay would be no option<hr>

This task is meant to teach you the basics of **git and terminal commands** in a fun game-like manner. You can use [this resource](https://linuxjourney.com/lesson/the-shell) to learn the basics and you must find the rest through google

You can start this task by first cloning it into your system. Document your journey for the future travellers. **Include all the commands you used and store all the passwords that you find along the way in a text file. Make sure to commit the changes after finishing every part.** 

## 1. Find the Facility

The only way to survive this apocalypse is by leaving Earth and reaching for the stars. There's a **facility** hidden somewhere on Earth that is trying to find a way to survive. **Find it** and get the first piece of the puzzle (the gravity equation) to escape Earth

## 2. Enter the wormhole

You've found all you need to in Earth. Now it's time to leave Earth and go to Gargantua. To do so though, first you have to go to the **wormhole** near Saturn's ring but it warps the space around it and is very difficult to find. The **wormhole** is hidden so you'll have to find it, make it executable and then go through it to get your second key. Now you can move back to root and then go to the **Gargantua System**

## 3. Analyze the planets in Gargantuan System

It's time to enter your new stellar system by changing branches. Now that your finally in gargantua explore the plantes and find one that's compatible with us. It must be screaming that it's habitable to us, must be smaller than 105 and must also be bigger than 100 or else it won't last and will only be a temporary sanctuary. Beware, for it won't be easy to find.

## 4. Gargantua

U have found the planet which is habitable. Now you must get the message to Earth in time for them to leave and survive. Enter the blackhole **Gargantua** and find the message from **Them**. Now make a `solve.sh` file and script it so that it takes a string as input and then decodes the given string from **base-b4**. Finally, give the clues you've found so far to the script file <hr>
At last, the task is done and Earth is saved. Now save and commit all the changes along with the screenshot of completion and remember that while your journey through the stars is over, your journey with amFOSS has only just begun
